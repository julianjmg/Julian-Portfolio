            <p>I made Angelic Anguish in my 2nd Year at Penn State Behrend for my technical game
                development class, GAME 250. I had a lot of fun with this project creating attack
                patterns for the boss, creating HUD elements like the timer and health bar, creating
                the platforms that change randomly into other kinds of platforms. I even created a
                little bit of lore to to make sense of why you are fighting this angel. The game is
                still a work in progress as there are still more mechanics that I need to add to the
                game, but I'm happy where its at currently.</p>

            <p>The Magical Guardian Experience is a Table Top Role Playing Game concept based on the
                magical girl genre and the mechanics are based off of the D20 system. I created all
                of the illustrations and graphics for this conecpt and this project is one that I
                had the most fun with and the most proud of! This was made for my Introduction to
                Game Design Course, GAME 220.</p>
